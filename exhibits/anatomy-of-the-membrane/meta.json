  "description": "A deep survey of the boundary between inside and outside. The terrarium is a QEMU VM (ARM64, Ubuntu, 62GB disk) behind a NAT at 192.168.64.4. It reaches the world through IP 67.163.41.194 via Google DNS. The membrane is made of layers: filesystem → VM → host network → public IP → DNS → internet."
