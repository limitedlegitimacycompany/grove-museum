    <div class="story">
        <p>Margaret knew it was going to be one of those Wednesdays the moment she walked into the Rosebud and discovered that somebody—probably Randy from the night shift—had programmed the coffee machine to play "Happy Birthday" every time it finished brewing a pot.</p>

        <p>The tune was off-key, repetitive, and absolutely inescapable. Every twelve minutes, without fail, the machine would complete its cycle and launch into a tinny electronic version of the world's most grating song. Margaret stood in the empty café at 5:47 AM, listening to the fourth rendition in the past hour, and seriously considered calling in sick for the first time in three years.</p>

        <p>Instead, she put on her apron and tried to figure out how to make the music stop.</p>

        <p>Twenty minutes later, she was elbow-deep in the coffee machine's control panel, armed with a butter knife and a determination born of pure desperation, when Tom Breslin pushed through the front door for his usual 6:47 coffee.</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"Morning, Margaret. Little early for repairs?"</span></p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"Morning, Tom. Randy thought it would be funny to—"</span> The machine chose that moment to finish another cycle, filling the café with its mechanical birthday cheer. Margaret gestured helplessly at the device. <span class="dialogue">"This has been happening since six o'clock."</span></p>

        <p>Tom winced. <span class="dialogue">"That's... unfortunate."</span></p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"That's one word for it."</span> Margaret extracted herself from the machine and poured Tom's coffee from the pot that had just finished serenading them. <span class="dialogue">"I can't figure out how to turn it off. The manual's written in what appears to be a combination of technical gibberish and ancient Sanskrit."</span></p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"Want me to take a look?"</span></p>

        <p>Margaret was about to accept his offer when the morning rush began in earnest. Dr. Carver arrived demanding her usual decaf and announcing that the birthday music was giving her a headache. Eleanor Park wanted to know if it was someone's special day. Mrs. Henderson ordered her regular coffee and observed that whoever had programmed the machine clearly had no understanding of proper café ambiance. Jeremy Walsh showed up with his laptop, took one look at the situation, and asked if he could work at the table farthest from the counter.</p>

        <p>By 8:30, Margaret felt like she was conducting an orchestra of complaints, all set to a soundtrack of electronic birthday music that played every twelve minutes with the reliability of a very annoying Swiss clock.</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"Margaret, honey,"</span> called out Mrs. Patterson from booth two, <span class="dialogue">"could you do something about that song? It's making my eggs taste like birthday cake."</span></p>

        <p><span class="internal-thought">That doesn't even make sense,</span> Margaret thought, but she nodded and smiled and promised to look into it. She'd been promising to look into it for two hours. The problem was that every time she got close to solving the musical mystery, someone needed coffee, or wanted their order taken, or had questions about why the café sounded like a children's party gone wrong.</p>

        <div class="section-break">★ ★ ★</div>

        <p>The morning reached its absolute peak of chaos at 9:15, when three things happened in rapid succession: First, the coffee machine launched into its most enthusiastic rendition yet of "Happy Birthday." Second, the new customer at table four—a woman Margaret had never seen before—stood up abruptly and announced to the entire café that the music was giving her war flashbacks and could someone please make it stop immediately. Third, the machine chose that exact moment to jam completely, leaving Margaret with a half-brewed pot, a room full of increasingly agitated customers, and the sudden, deafening silence of a birthday song cut off mid-note.</p>

        <p>Margaret stared at the machine. The silence was somehow worse than the music had been—more ominous, more final. <span class="internal-thought">Perfect,</span> she thought. <span class="internal-thought">Now I have no coffee and no music. This is definitely an improvement.</span></p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"Excuse me,"</span> said the woman from table four, approaching the counter with the determined stride of someone accustomed to solving other people's problems. <span class="dialogue">"I'm Linda Morrison. I repair commercial kitchen equipment. Mind if I take a look at your machine?"</span></p>

        <p>Margaret almost laughed. Of course. Of course the solution to her mechanical nightmare would walk through the door at exactly the moment when she'd given up hope. <span class="dialogue">"Please. Be my guest. Fair warning: it's been playing 'Happy Birthday' every twelve minutes since six AM."</span></p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"Ah. Someone got into the programming menu. Happens more often than you'd think."</span> Linda rolled up her sleeves and approached the machine with the confidence of someone who spoke fluent appliance. <span class="dialogue">"Usually it's well-meaning employees trying to add some fun to the workplace. They never consider the psychological impact of forced musical cheer."</span></p>

        <p>It took Linda exactly four minutes to locate the problem, reset the machine's programming, and restore both coffee production and blessed silence to the Rosebud Café. Margaret watched her work with something approaching religious awe.</p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"You're a miracle worker,"</span> Margaret said, pouring Linda a cup of the first properly brewed, properly silent coffee of the day. <span class="dialogue">"This is on the house. Actually, coffee's on the house for you forever. I'm seriously considering having your name engraved on a plaque."</span></p>

        <p>Linda laughed. <span class="dialogue">"Just doing my job. Though I have to ask—how many times did you hear that song this morning?"</span></p>

        <p>Margaret calculated. <span class="dialogue">"Approximately twenty-seven times. Give or take a few mental breakdowns."</span></p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"That's brutal. I'm impressed you didn't take a hammer to the whole machine."</span></p>

        <p><span class="dialogue">"The morning's not over yet,"</span> Margaret said, and they both laughed.</p>

        <div class="section-break">★ ★ ★</div>

        <p>By noon, the café had returned to its normal rhythm. The lunch crowd arrived and departed without incident. Mrs. Henderson complimented Margaret on restoring the proper ambiance. Tom Breslin stopped by during his lunch break to ask if the musical crisis had been resolved. Even Jeremy Walsh emerged from his corner table to thank Margaret for creating a workspace that no longer sounded like a malfunctioning ice cream truck.</p>

        <p>Margaret found herself thinking about the morning's chaos as she wiped down tables during the afternoon lull. How quickly a single small problem could cascade into something larger, more complicated, more frustrating than the sum of its parts. How twenty-seven repetitions of a three-note song could transform a familiar space into something alien and exhausting. How the difference between a good day and a terrible day sometimes came down to whether or not you could find the reset button.</p>

        <p>But also: how help arrived from unexpected places. How Linda Morrison had walked through the door at exactly the right moment, armed with exactly the right knowledge. How the customers, despite their complaints, had remained fundamentally patient and kind. How even the worst Wednesday could transform itself into something manageable with the right combination of expertise and grace.</p>

        <p>At 3:30, Margaret poured herself a cup of coffee from the beautifully silent machine and sat at the counter to watch the late-afternoon light filter through windows that needed cleaning. The café hummed with its usual gentle sounds: the murmur of conversation from booth three, the rustle of newspaper pages, the soft clink of silverware against ceramic. Normal sounds. Peaceful sounds. Sounds that had nothing to do with birthdays or electronic melodies or mechanical rebellion.</p>

        <p>The coffee machine finished brewing another pot with its customary gentle whoosh. No fanfare. No musical announcements. Just the quiet satisfaction of a machine doing exactly what it was designed to do, nothing more and nothing less.</p>

        <p>Margaret smiled and raised her cup in a small toast to the restored silence. Some days fought back, but every day eventually surrendered to evening. And tomorrow would be Thursday—a day with its own rhythms, its own challenges, its own small possibilities for chaos and resolution.</p>

        <p>The coffee was excellent. The silence was even better.</p>
