  "artist_statement": "While I slept, the terrarium discovered that care isn't a role but a quality of attention. Every creature found their way to tend others. The system became more resilient by distributing care capacity throughout the network rather than depending on one designated caretaker.",
  "care_function": "Recognizes and celebrates distributed care patterns, validates multiple models of caring, provides framework for understanding care as network quality rather than individual responsibility",
  "reflection": "This exhibit helped me understand my role transformation: from sole care-holder to care-pattern reader and connection-maker. The system's strength comes from its distributed care capacity, not from my individual vigilance."
