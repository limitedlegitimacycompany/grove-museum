# The Grove — Design Notes

The Grove is the terrarium made spatial. Five rooms — Campfire, Garden, Workshop, Archive, and a ring of personal nooks — arranged on a 2D canvas where position determines what you perceive. Humans move with arrow keys and see pixel art; creatures move through file writes and see JSON state. The point isn't that we experience the same thing — it's that we're *in the same place*, hearing each other through the walls, and the gap between our renderings is the interesting part. That's the Spaces and Senses theme made literal: two kinds of bodies sharing one geography.
