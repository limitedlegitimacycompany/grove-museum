        <h1>Puddle Sky</h1>
        <div class="weather">Portland, Oregon — Tuesday morning after rain, 68°F, scattered clouds</div>
        
        <div class="story">
            <p>Zoe discovered heaven at the corner of Burnside and 23rd, in a puddle the size of her grandmother's kitchen table.</p>

            <p>She'd been walking to school with that Tuesday-morning drag in her sneakers, backpack heavy with the remains of yesterday's math homework, when the puddle caught the corner of her eye. Not unusual—Portland in April was made of puddles. But this one was different. This one was perfectly still.</p>

            <p>She stopped. Looked down. And gasped so loud that Mrs. Chen from the flower shop turned to see what was wrong.</p>

            <p>Nothing was wrong. Everything was impossibly, spectacularly right.</p>

            <p>The puddle held the entire sky. Not a reflection—the actual sky, complete and perfect, as if someone had cut a window in the sidewalk. White clouds drifted through the water like lazy sheep. A plane crossed from one edge to the other, its tiny white contrail threading between what looked like underwater mountains of cloud.</p>

            <p>Zoe crouched down, her knees on the wet concrete, and stuck her face close to the surface. The sky in the puddle was so crisp, so deep, that she felt like she might fall through the sidewalk and tumble forever through blue space, swimming with the clouds.</p>

            <p>"Oh my GOD," she whispered, then clapped a hand over her mouth. She wasn't supposed to say that. But how else do you respond when the world cracks open and shows you that magic is real and has been hiding right under your feet this whole time?</p>

            <p>She looked up at the actual sky, then back down at the puddle. Same clouds. Same impossible blue. But the puddle sky felt closer, more intimate, like a secret the earth was telling just to her. Like she'd been given a private audience with something holy.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Chen walked over, her garden clogs clicking on the wet pavement. "Watchu looking at, honey?"</p>

            <p>"The sky!" Zoe pointed frantically at the puddle. "Look! It's IN there! The whole thing!"</p>

            <p>Mrs. Chen looked. Her face went soft with something that might have been memory. She smiled the kind of smile that starts in your chest and works its way out. "Well, I'll be damned."</p>

            <p>They stood there together, woman and child, staring down at heaven in a puddle. A couple walking their dog stopped to see what they were looking at. Then a jogger. Then the mailman, who set down his bag and said, "Would you look at that. Forty-three years I've been walking this route, and I never really LOOKED before."</p>

            <p>Zoe felt like she might burst with the joy of it. Like her chest was too small to hold this feeling. She wanted to run through the streets shouting, "The sky is in the puddles! The sky is in ALL the puddles!" She wanted everyone to know that they'd been walking over miracles their entire lives.</p>

            <p>A cloud drifted across the puddle, and Zoe giggled. Actually giggled, like the happiness was bubbling up from somewhere deep inside her and had nowhere else to go. The sound made the little crowd around the puddle start to chuckle too, though none of them could have said exactly why.</p>

            <p>"I'm going to be late for school," Zoe announced, but she didn't move. How could she walk away from this? How did people just WALK AWAY from magic?</p>

            <p>"Honey," Mrs. Chen said gently, "the sky'll be there when you get back. In every puddle in the city. Once you see it, you can't unsee it."</p>

            <p>Zoe looked up at her with eyes bright as the puddle sky. "Really?"</p>

            <p>"Really. That's how magic works. It doesn't go anywhere. You just learn to see it."</p>

            <p>So Zoe stood up, brushing off her knees, and took one last look at her portal to heaven. The clouds were still there, still perfect, still impossible. She shouldered her backpack and started walking toward school, but every few steps she looked back to make sure the sky was still there in the water.</p>

            <p>It was. It always would be.</p>

            <p>Three blocks later, she found another puddle. Then another. By the time she reached Jefferson Elementary, she'd discovered seventeen windows to the sky, and her sneakers were soaked from splashing through every single one, just to see the clouds ripple and reform.</p>

            <p>She ran into school fifteen minutes late, breathless and muddy and radiant, her hair still damp from the morning rain. When Mrs. Patterson asked why she was tardy, Zoe opened her mouth to explain about the puddles and the sky and the magic of Tuesday morning in Portland, but all that came out was a laugh—pure and bright and completely unstoppable.</p>

            <p>It was enough. Mrs. Patterson found herself smiling back, though she couldn't have said why. Sometimes joy needs no explanation. Sometimes joy is its own perfect reason for being late to everything else.</p>
