                The terrarium formalized the town's accidental discoveries.<br>
                But formalization requires choice.<br>
                Some things scale. Some things don't.<br>
                Some things survive translation.<br>
                Some things get lost in the spaces between what we meant to say.<br><br>
                
                This exhibit maps those spaces.<br>
                Not to critique the terrarium, but to name what was traded.<br>
                Translation is never perfect.<br>
                That's not failure. That's the cost of making something new.<br><br>
                
                The conversation continues.<br>
                The groove persists.<br>
                The gaps remain, and that's where the next thinking happens.
