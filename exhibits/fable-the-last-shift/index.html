    <div class="story">
        <p>Margaret's hands knew the weight of the coffee pot before her mind did. Twenty-three years of five-thirty starts, and her fingers still found the handle in the dark, still measured the grounds by sound rather than sight. The diner's fluorescent lights hummed their familiar tune as she flipped the switches, one by one, bringing the Rosebud Café to life for what she now knew would be the last time.</p>

        <p>Outside, Millbrook was still sleeping under a thin February snow. She could see her own reflection in the window—sixty-two years old, gray hair pulled back in the same ponytail she'd worn since the eighties, apron already tied around her waist. In four hours, she would untie that apron, hang up her order pad, and walk out into whatever came next.</p>

        <p>The coffee began its slow percolation, and Margaret allowed herself one moment of stillness. The retirement party was yesterday. Her replacement, a girl named Destiny with bright pink nails and ambitions beyond Millbrook, would start Monday. Everyone had said their goodbyes, brought their casseroles and congratulations. But this morning was just Margaret and the silence before the day began.</p>

        <p>She moved through the familiar choreography: napkin dispensers filled, salt shakers wiped clean, the register checked and double-checked. Her feet traced the same path they'd worn smooth in the linoleum—from coffee station to grill, from booth three to the pie case, around and around like a prayer she'd memorized in muscle and bone.</p>

        <p>At six-fifteen, Harold pushed through the door with a blast of cold air and the smell of tire shop on his coveralls. He'd been ordering the same breakfast for eighteen years: two eggs over easy, wheat toast, crisp bacon, coffee black as motor oil. Margaret had his plate ready before he'd settled onto his usual stool.</p>

        <p>"Morning, Maggie," he said, and she noticed how carefully he didn't say anything else, how his eyes avoided hers as he unfolded his newspaper. They'd never talked much, she and Harold, but she would miss the comfortable weight of his presence, the way he left exact change plus a twenty percent tip, no more, no less.</p>

        <p>The morning rush followed its predictable rhythm. Teachers grabbing coffee to-go, construction workers loading up on pancakes, Mrs. Kellerman ordering her usual decaf and wheat toast, cut diagonally, with the crusts removed. Margaret had memorized them all—their orders, their stories, the small ways they marked time in this corner booth or that window table.</p>

        <div class="break">* * *</div>

        <p>Around ten, when the rush had quieted to a steady murmur, Sarah Chen slipped in and took the corner booth. She was maybe thirty-five, a newcomer to Millbrook who'd moved here after her divorce, worked remotely for some company in Chicago. She always ordered chamomile tea and whatever pie was fresh, always had a book open beside her plate.</p>

        <p>"What's good today?" Sarah asked, though they both knew she'd order the apple cinnamon pie regardless of what Margaret recommended.</p>

        <p>"Everything's good on the last day," Margaret found herself saying, and immediately regretted it. She hadn't meant to be dramatic.</p>

        <p>Sarah looked up from her book—something thick with a woman in a long coat on the cover. "Last day?"</p>

        <p>"Retiring. This is it." Margaret kept her voice light, professional. "Twenty-three years of coffee and pie."</p>

        <p>Sarah set down her book entirely, giving Margaret her full attention in a way that was both kind and slightly unnerving. "That's a long time. You must have seen everything."</p>

        <p>"Most things," Margaret agreed. She'd seen couples fight and make up over her pancakes, watched children grow into teenagers who pretended not to know her, served coffee to three generations of the same families. She'd been here for births and deaths, celebrations and heartbreaks, ordinary Tuesdays that turned out to be the most important days of people's lives.</p>

        <p>"What will you miss most?" Sarah asked.</p>

        <p>Margaret considered this as she refilled Sarah's water glass. The honest answer was complicated. She'd miss the rhythm, the certainty of it. She'd miss knowing that somewhere in Millbrook, people depended on her to have their coffee ready, their usual table waiting. She'd miss the way Harold's shoulders relaxed when he walked through the door, how Mrs. Kellerman's face lit up when Margaret remembered to cut the crusts off her toast.</p>

        <p>"The mornings," she said finally. "Before anyone else gets here. When it's just me and the possibility of the day."</p>

        <div class="break">* * *</div>

        <p>By two o'clock, the lunch crowd had thinned to a few stragglers, and Margaret found herself moving more slowly, as if she could stretch these final hours by taking her time. She wiped tables that were already clean, restocked supplies that didn't need restocking, checked the coffee levels obsessively.</p>

        <p>Destiny stopped by around three, ostensibly to drop off some paperwork but really to watch Margaret work, to see how she handled the afternoon lull, the way she anticipated what customers needed before they asked for it. Margaret tried not to feel protective of her routines, her small efficiencies. After all, she'd learned them from someone else—Betty Morrison, who'd trained her in 2001 and retired two years later to take care of her mother.</p>

        <p>"Any last-minute advice?" Destiny asked, pen poised over a notepad covered in bright pink ink.</p>

        <p>Margaret thought about all the things that couldn't be written down: how to read the temperature of a marriage by the way a couple ordered coffee, when to refill a cup without being asked, how to make small talk that mattered without being intrusive. How to hold space for people's daily sorrows and small joys without taking them on as your own.</p>

        <p>"Keep the coffee fresh," she said instead. "And remember everyone's name if you can. People like to be known."</p>

        <p>Destiny nodded seriously and wrote this down, though Margaret suspected she'd figure out her own way of doing things soon enough. That was how it worked. The diner would go on, slightly different but essentially the same, serving coffee and comfort to whoever needed it.</p>

        <div class="break">* * *</div>

        <p>At four-thirty, as the light outside turned thin and gray, Margaret began the closing routine she'd performed thousands of times. She cleaned the grill, wiped down the counters, counted the register. But tonight she also did things she'd never done before: she wrote notes for Destiny about which suppliers delivered when, which customers had standing orders, how to work around the temperamental freezer door that only opened if you lifted it slightly while pulling.</p>

        <p>Harold had left an hour ago with a nod that somehow contained twenty-three years of shared mornings. Mrs. Kellerman had squeezed Margaret's hand and promised to visit her granddaughter in Portland. Sarah had given her a book—the one she'd been reading, with a note inside the cover: "For new chapters. Thank you for the pie and the conversation."</p>

        <p>Now it was just Margaret and the empty diner, the chairs stacked on tables, the lights turned low. She stood behind the counter one more time, looking out at the dining room she knew as well as her own bedroom. Tomorrow morning, someone else would flip these switches, brew this coffee, greet these customers. The thought was both liberating and terrifying.</p>

        <p>She untied her apron slowly, folding it carefully before hanging it on the hook by the coffee station. Her keys made a soft sound as she set them on the counter next to Destiny's paperwork. Then she put on her coat, picked up the book Sarah had given her, and walked to the door.</p>

        <p>Outside, the February air was sharp and clean. Snow crunched under her feet as she crossed the parking lot to her car. Behind her, the Rosebud Café stood dark and patient, waiting for Monday morning, for Destiny's fresh energy and pink nails and different way of making coffee.</p>

        <p>Margaret sat in her car for a moment, engine running, heat slowly warming her fingers. Through the windshield, she could see her house at the end of Maple Street, yellow porch light glowing. Her retirement. Her new life. Her mornings that would no longer begin at five-thirty.</p>

        <p>She put the car in drive and headed home, carrying with her the weight of every cup of coffee she'd poured, every story she'd witnessed, every small kindness she'd offered across a worn formica counter. It wasn't much, maybe, in the grand scheme of things. But it was everything she'd had to give, and she'd given it well.</p>

        <p>The snow continued to fall as she drove through the quiet streets of Millbrook, covering the tracks she'd made, preparing the world for whatever came next.</p>
