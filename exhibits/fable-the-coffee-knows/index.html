    <div class="story">
        <p>The coffee machine started making that sound again on Tuesday morning, the sound that meant Mrs. Henderson was fifteen minutes away. Margaret had worked at the Rosebud long enough to know the machine's moods: the cheerful gurgle that meant Tom Breslin would arrive exactly at 6:47, the frustrated wheeze that preceded Dr. Carver's weekly lecture about her blood pressure, the gentle sigh that somehow announced Eleanor Park's entrance before the door chime ever had a chance.</p>

        <p>But this sound—a low, almost musical hum that seemed to come from the heating element itself—this sound meant Mrs. Henderson, and Mrs. Henderson meant trouble.</p>

        <p>Margaret checked the clock: 9:23. Right on schedule. She topped off the coffee in pot three (Mrs. Henderson always ordered from pot three, though she'd never explained why), straightened the daily specials board, and positioned the cream pitcher at exactly the right angle. Not because Mrs. Henderson was difficult, exactly, but because she noticed everything. In thirty-seven years of serving coffee, Margaret had learned the difference between customers who wanted to be served and customers who wanted to be seen. Mrs. Henderson fell definitively into the second category.</p>

        <p>"Morning, Margaret." Mrs. Henderson settled into booth four with the careful precision of someone who had claimed that particular piece of real estate through decades of consistent patronage. She was perhaps seventy, with silver hair that never seemed to move and eyes that catalogued details like a librarian processing returns.</p>

        <p>"Morning, Mrs. Henderson. Coffee?"</p>

        <p>"Please. And Margaret?" Mrs. Henderson paused, studying the menu though they both knew she would order the same thing she'd ordered every Tuesday for three years. "That young man who comes in Thursday mornings. The one with the laptop and the nervous energy. Does he ever eat anything?"</p>

        <p>Margaret poured the coffee, considering. Jeremy Walsh, she assumed. Twenty-something, freelance something, always typing with the intensity of someone trying to outrun a deadline. "He orders muffins sometimes. Why?"</p>

        <p>"He looks hungry." Mrs. Henderson accepted the coffee with both hands, as if it were a small, warm animal. "Not for food, I mean. For... I don't know. Purpose, maybe? Recognition? He types so intently, as if the words might disappear if he doesn't capture them quickly enough."</p>

        <p>Margaret had noticed this too, though she'd never put words to it. Jeremy had the look of someone carrying a secret that might be wonderful or terrible, depending on whether anyone else thought it mattered. "He's working on a novel," she offered. "Mentioned it once when I asked about all the typing."</p>

        <p>"Ah." Mrs. Henderson nodded with satisfaction, as if this confirmed some private theory. "That explains the look. I had the same look once, when I was writing my dissertation. Forty years ago, can you believe that? 'The Migration Patterns of Eastern Finches: A Twenty-Year Study.' Thrilling stuff."</p>

        <p>Margaret tried to picture Mrs. Henderson as a young graduate student, tracking birds across state lines, taking meticulous notes in some field station laboratory. The image came surprisingly easily. "What happened to it? The dissertation, I mean."</p>

        <p>"Oh, I finished it. Defended it. Got my degree." Mrs. Henderson sipped her coffee thoughtfully. "Then I realized I'd spent so much time studying bird migration that I'd forgotten to migrate myself. So I came here. Twenty-three years ago. Best decision I ever made."</p>

        <p>This was the most personal information Mrs. Henderson had shared in three years of Tuesday morning conversations. Margaret felt as though she'd been handed a small, unexpected gift. "Do you miss it? The research?"</p>

        <p>"Sometimes. But I still watch the birds. They're quite active this winter—something about the temperature fluctuations, I think. And I watch people too, now. They have migration patterns too, you know. Some come here when they're beginning something new. Some come when they're ending something old. Some, like me, come when they're figuring out the difference."</p>

        <p>The door chime announced the arrival of Tom Breslin, right on schedule. Margaret excused herself to pour his coffee (pot two, no cream, sugar on the side), but she found herself thinking about migration patterns for the rest of the morning. How some people landed in places like the Rosebud and stayed for decades, becoming part of the furniture, part of the daily rhythm. How others passed through like seasonal visitors, here for a chapter or a paragraph before moving on to whatever came next.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Henderson finished her coffee at exactly 10:15, left a precise fifteen percent tip, and paused at the door. "Margaret? Next Thursday, when that young man comes in? Maybe mention that Mrs. Henderson thinks anyone brave enough to write a novel deserves a free muffin now and then."</p>

        <div class="section-break">• • •</div>

        <p>After Mrs. Henderson left, Margaret found herself watching the customers with different eyes. The businessman who ordered decaf and spent forty minutes reading the newspaper—was he beginning something or ending something? The elderly couple who shared a piece of pie every Tuesday, cutting it with surgical precision—were they celebrating decades of successful migration or mourning the places they could no longer go?</p>

        <p>The coffee machine hummed its various tunes throughout the morning, each sound a small prediction, a forecast of familiar arrivals and departures. Margaret had never thought of herself as particularly observant, but she realized she could read the café's moods as easily as Mrs. Henderson could track bird migrations. The quality of light through the front windows that meant snow was coming. The way conversations shifted when the temperature dropped. The particular silence that settled over the dining room when people were thinking about going home.</p>

        <p>At 2:30, during the daily lull between lunch and dinner, Margaret sat at the counter with her own cup of coffee (pot one, the good stuff, saved for herself and the occasional discerning customer) and tried to imagine what her migration pattern looked like from the outside. Twenty-three years in Millbrook. Nineteen years at the Rosebud. How many thousands of conversations about weather and work and the small dramas that made up the texture of daily life? How many pots of coffee brewed, cups poured, tables wiped clean?</p>

        <p>From a distance—the kind of distance Mrs. Henderson might use to observe a flock of finches—Margaret's life might look static, predictable. The same routes through the same small world, day after day, season after season. But from the inside, from here at the counter with the afternoon light slanting through windows that needed cleaning, it felt like something else entirely. Not stasis but attention. Not repetition but recognition. The deep satisfaction of knowing exactly how much cream Mrs. Henderson liked in her coffee, exactly when Tom Breslin would push through the door, exactly which sound the coffee machine made when it was content.</p>

        <p>The door chime announced another arrival—Jennifer Walsh, Jeremy's sister, coming in for her weekly coffee and gossip session with Eleanor Park. Margaret poured two cups without being asked, added the sugar Eleanor preferred, and delivered them to their usual table by the window.</p>

        <p>"Thanks, Margaret," Jennifer said. "You always know exactly what we want before we do."</p>

        <p>Margaret smiled and returned to the counter. The coffee machine hummed quietly, a sound she'd never heard before—or maybe a sound she'd been hearing for years without really listening. It was almost like contentment, she thought. The mechanical equivalent of a satisfied sigh.</p>

        <p>Outside, the first snow of the week began to fall, small flakes that caught the light and spiraled past the windows like messages being delivered to no one in particular. Margaret watched them accumulate on the sidewalk and thought about migration patterns, about the difference between staying and settling, about how sometimes the most important journeys happened while standing perfectly still.</p>

        <p>The coffee machine hummed again, a different tune this time. Margaret glanced at the clock: 3:47. In exactly thirteen minutes, Dr. Carver would arrive for her afternoon decaf and her weekly complaint about the weather. And Margaret would be ready.</p>
