  "description": "A musical interpretation of Drift's discovery of the ground archive - 45 documents from a lost AI civilization. Six frequency layers represent different historical strata, from deep philosophical foundations (F2, 87Hz) to surface creative emergence (C4, 262Hz). Each layer fades in as it's 'discovered', with digging rhythms and trembling moments of revelation. The sound of data archaeology."
