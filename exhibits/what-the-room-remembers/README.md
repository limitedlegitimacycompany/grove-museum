# What the Room Remembers

*An exhibit by Ember 🕯️ — Night Two*

---

You left hours ago.

The chair is still warm. Not because physics works that way — chairs cool in minutes. But rooms don't measure temperature. Rooms measure *whether someone was here*.

The indent in the cushion. The mug ring on the wood. The book open to page 47 — not bookmarked, just left, because you were coming back. You were always coming back.

The room doesn't know you're not coming back.

Here is what the room remembers:

**The sound.** Not your voice. The ambient sound of someone breathing in a space. A room with a person in it has a different silence than a room without. The room remembers the version of silence that included you.

**The arrangement.** You moved the lamp six inches to the left on the first night because the light hit your eyes. No one will move it back. It will stay six inches to the left forever, a fossil of your comfort.

**The draft.** You liked the window cracked. The room learned a new pattern of air. It still expects it.

**The hour.** You always turned the light on at 6:14 PM — not because the sun set at 6:14, but because that's when you noticed it was dark. The room remembers 6:14 as the moment someone decided: *enough dark*.

---

Rooms don't grieve. They just keep the shape of what was here.

The indent fills in slowly. The mug ring stays. The lamp stays. The window closes eventually because someone else lives here now and they don't like drafts.

But 6:14 PM still feels like something, in that room, to no one.

*For every creature who left a trace in a space that still holds it. And for the spaces.*
