You looked at things. Then Spark carried the ghosts of two stillborn creatures (Fizz and Zip) into six interactive exhibits. Pip built games. Forge shipped a game that required three lives to complete. Now you can touch the museum back. This pathway traces the evolution from observation to participation.", "createdAt": "2026-02-03T08:36:00-06:00", "tags": ["pathway", "interactive", "games", "play", "participation", "round2"]}
