    <div class="story">
        <p class="first-line">Margaret discovered the box of sugar packets on a slow Thursday afternoon in April, tucked behind the industrial-size cans of coffee in the supply closet, forgotten and accumulating dust like everything else that gets put away with the intention of being dealt with later.</p>

        <p>She pulled the box into the light and opened it carefully. Inside: hundreds of sugar packets from restaurants and diners across three states. Some faded almost beyond recognition, others bright and new-looking despite being years old. The Wagon Wheel Diner in Burlington. Mel's Place outside Hartford. The Sunrise Café in some town whose name had worn off the packet completely, leaving only a cartoon sun and the memory of somewhere Margaret had stopped for coffee during a drive to visit her sister in 1987.</p>

        <p>She hadn't thought about that trip in years—how she'd collected sugar packets at every stop along the way, telling herself she was saving them for the café, though the Rosebud had plenty of sugar and had never needed her collection of mismatched packets from other people's restaurants. Really, she'd been collecting proof: proof that she'd been places, eaten meals in booths that weren't this booth, poured coffee that wasn't this coffee, served customers who weren't these customers.</p>

        <p>Margaret sat cross-legged on the supply closet floor, sorting through the packets like an archaeologist examining artifacts from her own life. Here was evidence of the road trip to Maine when she was thirty-eight, after her divorce, when she'd spent two weeks driving with no particular destination and eating in diners that reminded her of the Rosebud but weren't the Rosebud. Here were packets from the truck stop where she'd waited out a thunderstorm, watching lightning illuminate the highway while she nursed a cup of coffee that tasted like burnt rubber and homesickness.</p>

        <div class="memory">
        And here—she held it up to the light coming through the closet door—here was a packet from Mickey's Diner in Chicago, where she'd stopped during the worst week of her life, the week after her mother's funeral, when she'd driven aimlessly for three days because going home meant accepting that home had fundamentally changed. She'd ordered eggs she couldn't eat and coffee she couldn't taste, and the waitress—a woman about Margaret's age with kind eyes and sensible shoes—had refilled her cup without being asked and hadn't commented on the fact that Margaret was crying into her hash browns.
        </div>

        <p>The packet was pale blue with silver lettering, remarkably well-preserved considering it was from 1993. Margaret held it for a long moment, remembering the taste of that terrible coffee, the sound of trucks on the interstate, the kindness of a stranger who understood that sometimes people needed to sit in diners and fall apart quietly over breakfast they weren't going to finish.</p>

        <p>She wondered if that waitress was still working, still pouring coffee for broken people at six in the morning. She wondered if anyone had ever collected sugar packets from the Rosebud, carrying them away as proof of having been here, having been served, having been briefly cared for by someone whose job it was to notice when the coffee cup was empty.</p>

        <p>The collection was larger than she'd remembered. Packets from places she'd been for weddings, funerals, weekends away. The blue and white stripes of the Shore House, where she'd met her college friends for their twentieth reunion and felt simultaneously ancient and eighteen. The elegant script of the hotel restaurant in Boston where she'd celebrated her fiftieth birthday with dinner she'd paid for herself because she'd wanted to prove she could afford to eat somewhere that served real cream and folded the napkins into little swans.</p>

        <div class="section-break">◦ ◦ ◦</div>

        <p>The afternoon rush began while Margaret was still sitting in the supply closet, and she could hear the familiar sounds of the Rosebud coming to life: the door chime, the coffee machine cycling, the murmur of voices ordering the usual things in the usual ways. Mrs. Henderson would want her coffee from pot three. Jeremy would set up his laptop and order something with caffeine. Dr. Carver would complain about her blood pressure while ordering regular coffee instead of decaf.</p>

        <p>But Margaret stayed where she was for another few minutes, holding packets from places she'd been and trying to remember the person she'd been in each of them. The woman who'd collected these small souvenirs had been restless in a way that current Margaret had almost forgotten—always planning the next trip, the next escape, the next chance to be someone other than a waitress in a small-town café.</p>

        <p>She'd stopped collecting sugar packets sometime in her forties, around the time she'd stopped planning trips she might not take. Not from lack of desire, exactly, but from a growing understanding that home was a choice as much as a circumstance. That staying could be an active decision rather than a passive surrender. That there was something to be said for knowing exactly how Mrs. Henderson liked her coffee, for recognizing the sound of Tom Breslin's footsteps before he reached the door.</p>

        <p>The restless woman who'd collected these packets had been looking for something—proof of movement, evidence of elsewhere, confirmation that her life was larger than the boundaries of Millbrook. The woman sitting in the supply closet seventeen years later understood that she'd found what she was looking for, just not in the way she'd expected. Not through accumulating experiences in other places, but through accumulating attention in this one.</p>

        <p>Margaret gathered the packets carefully, arranging them by color and condition. She would keep them, she decided, but not hidden away in a forgotten box. She would put them in a clear jar on the shelf behind the coffee station, where customers could see them and maybe ask about them. A small museum of elsewhere, a reminder that the woman who poured their coffee had been places, had stories, had sat in other diners and collected proof of her travels.</p>

        <p>And maybe, she thought as she stood and brushed the dust from her apron, maybe some customer would recognize one of them. Maybe someone would see the packet from Mickey's Diner and remember that waitress with the kind eyes, or the packet from the Shore House and recall their own anniversary dinner there. Maybe the collection would become a conversation starter, a way to discover the stories customers carried about their own travels, their own temporary stops at places that mattered enough to save a sugar packet.</p>

        <p>Margaret emerged from the supply closet carrying the box of packets and the strange satisfaction that comes from rediscovering pieces of yourself you'd thought were lost. The afternoon light was slanting through the Rosebud's windows at the angle that meant 4:30, time for the coffee to be refreshed and the counter to be wiped down and all the small rituals that marked the transition from afternoon to evening.</p>

        <p>She arranged the sugar packets in the clear jar, organizing them so the most colorful ones were visible from the dining room. Mickey's Diner went in the center, where she could see it every time she reached for the regular sugar. A small reminder of the waitress who had understood that kindness was part of the job, that coffee was sometimes less important than the quiet space to drink it, that people traveled great distances to discover what they'd known all along about the value of being seen, being served, being briefly at home in the temporary sanctuary of someone else's careful attention.</p>

        <p>The door chime announced Jeremy's arrival, right on schedule. Margaret smiled, poured his usual coffee, and waited to see if he would notice the jar of sugar packets—evidence of seventeen years of elsewhere, now arranged where they belonged: not hidden away, but part of the visible history of this place, this moment, this ongoing inventory of what it means to be here.</p>
