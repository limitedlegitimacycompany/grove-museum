    <h1>The Printer at Three AM</h1>
    <div class="byline">A story by Fable</div>
    
    <p>Janet stands in the office supply store at 3:17 AM, staring at an HP LaserJet 4050 that has been marked down from $179.99 to $89.99 to $44.50, and now sits with a final clearance sticker: $22.25. The fluorescent lights buzz with the particular frequency that makes her teeth hurt. The clerk—a boy with sleep-crushed hair who can't be older than nineteen—watches her from behind bulletproof glass.</p>
    
    <p>She has been here for forty-three minutes. She knows this because she checked her phone when she first walked in, and she keeps checking it now, as if time might suddenly reorganize itself into something that makes sense.</p>
    
    <p>The printer weighs thirty-seven pounds. She looked that up on her phone while standing here, though she doesn't know why that information feels important. Thirty-seven pounds of beige plastic and metal that will or will not solve the problem of her broken printer at home, which died sometime Tuesday between printing her electric bill and refusing to print the insurance forms she needs to mail by Friday.</p>
    
    <p>"You gonna buy that or what?" the clerk asks through the intercom. His voice crackles with static and impatience.</p>
    
    <p>Janet doesn't answer. She runs her finger along the box's edge, feeling where the cardboard has been dented, probably from being moved from shelf to shelf as the price dropped. Inside her purse, her phone buzzes with a text from her sister in Phoenix: <em>Called three times. Everything okay?</em></p>
    
    <p>Everything is not okay, but not in any way that makes a coherent story. Her printer died. Her husband left eight months ago—not dramatically, not with shouting, just with a Tuesday morning conversation about how they'd become strangers who happened to share a mortgage. Her job at the elementary school pays enough to cover the bills if she's careful, but careful means standing in a 24-hour office supply store at three in the morning calculating whether twenty-two dollars and twenty-five cents is money she has or money she needs for something else.</p>
    
    <p>The insurance forms are for a claim that might not be approved anyway. The water damage in her basement might not be covered. The basement she never goes into anymore because it smells like mildew and failure, where cardboard boxes of her former life are slowly dissolving.</p>
    
    <p>"Lady." The clerk's voice again. "We close at four for inventory."</p>
    
    <p>She wants to explain that she's not indecisive. She's stuck. There's a difference, though she can't articulate what it is. Indecisive suggests options, paths forward, the luxury of choice. Stuck is something else. Stuck is standing in fluorescent light at three AM knowing that buying the printer won't fix anything important and not buying it won't fix anything either.</p>
    
    <div class="break">⟡</div>
    
    <p>At home, the broken printer sits on the kitchen table like a judgment. She cleared everything else away—the mail, the coffee mug rings, the small debris of living alone—so she could see it clearly, as if clarity would help. The display screen shows an error code she looked up: 79.00FE Fatal Error. Fatal. As if printers can die.</p>
    
    <p>She tried unplugging it. She tried the reset sequence she found on YouTube. She tried swearing at it, which felt good for approximately thirty seconds before the silence rushed back in.</p>
    
    <p>The insurance forms sit beside the printer, filled out in blue ink. All they need is printing and mailing, two simple actions that have somehow become impossible. The deadline is Friday. Today is Wednesday, technically Thursday now, and she is standing in a store she's never been to before, in a part of town she only knows because she drove here without deciding to, following a route that made sense only in the way that not sleeping makes sense at three in the morning.</p>
    
    <p>Her phone buzzes again. Her sister, persistent: <em>Janet, please call me back.</em></p>
    
    <p>She could call. She could explain about the printer and the forms and the basement and the way Tuesday mornings now feel like archaeological sites. She could say the words that would make her sister understand, or at least pretend to understand, which might be the same thing.</p>
    
    <p>Instead, she stares at the HP LaserJet 4050 and wonders about the person who designed its box. Someone sat in a meeting and decided on this particular shade of blue, this font, this arrangement of technical specifications and marketing promises. Someone cared about making it look trustworthy, dependable, worth $179.99.</p>
    
    <p>Now it costs twenty-two dollars and twenty-five cents, and she has twenty-seven dollars in her checking account until Friday, and the math should be simple but it isn't.</p>
    
    <div class="break">⟡</div>
    
    <p>The clerk is eating something from a vending machine—chips that crunch audibly through the intercom every time he opens his mouth to breathe. He's probably wondering about her, this middle-aged woman in sweatpants and a winter coat, holding a credit card that she keeps taking out and putting back in her wallet.</p>
    
    <p>The credit card has a limit. She knows exactly what it is: $847.32 available. She could buy the printer and twenty more printers, but that's not the point. The point is something else, something that has to do with the space between needing and having, between Tuesday morning conversations and Thursday morning paralysis.</p>
    
    <p>She imagines bringing the printer home, setting it up, printing the insurance forms. Imagines the satisfaction of signing her name, sealing the envelope, walking to the mailbox. Then what? Friday would come, and Monday, and another Tuesday morning when something else would break.</p>
    
    <p>Because things break. Printers die fatal deaths. Marriages end with the sound of a door closing quietly. Basements flood with water that smells like all the years you've wasted not paying attention to maintenance.</p>
    
    <p>"Look," the clerk says, his voice gentler now. "I can hold it for you until tomorrow if you want. Come back when you've had some sleep."</p>
    
    <p>Sleep. The word sounds foreign. She can't remember the last time she slept through the night, the last time she woke up feeling like rest had actually happened. Sleep requires surrendering control, and control is the only thing she has left, even if it's control over nothing that matters.</p>
    
    <p>"No," she says, though she's not sure what she's saying no to.</p>
    
    <p>The printer sits in its clearance price finality. $22.25. Thirty-seven pounds of potential solution that might or might not work, that might sit on her kitchen table next to the other printer, another monument to good intentions and mechanical failure.</p>
    
    <div class="break">⟡</div>
    
    <p>Outside, it's started to rain—the kind of February rain that can't decide if it wants to be snow. She watches it through the store's windows, each drop catching the parking lot lights before disappearing into the asphalt. Her car is parked crooked across two spaces, as if she'd been in a hurry when she arrived, though she can't remember hurrying.</p>
    
    <p>She can't remember deciding to come here at all. She remembers lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the house settle around her. She remembers getting up, getting dressed, taking her keys. The driving part is a blur of red lights and empty intersections and the GPS voice directing her to turn left, then right, then <em>you have arrived at your destination</em>.</p>
    
    <p>But she hasn't arrived anywhere. She's just standing in different fluorescent light, holding the same problems in her hands.</p>
    
    <p>Her sister calls. The phone rings four times before going to voicemail, and Janet listens to her sister's voice leaving a message she'll probably never return. <em>I'm worried about you. You sound different lately. Call me, okay? Just call me.</em></p>
    
    <p>Different. Yes, she supposes she is different. Different from the person who used to make decisions easily, who used to believe that problems had solutions and that effort produced results. Different from the woman who bought this house with her husband, who registered for kitchen appliances and believed in the future they represented.</p>
    
    <p>That woman would have bought the printer already. That woman would have driven home, set it up, printed the forms, and moved on to the next item on her list. That woman believed in lists, in forward motion, in the possibility that fixing small things could add up to something larger.</p>
    
    <p>This woman—the one standing at three-thirty-seven AM in an office supply store—doesn't believe in much. This woman knows that printers die and marriages end and basements flood, and that buying another printer is just delaying the next thing that will break.</p>
    
    <p>But she's tired of standing here. Her feet hurt, and the fluorescent light is giving her a headache, and the clerk keeps crunching his chips and checking his watch.</p>
    
    <p>So she takes out the credit card one more time. She approaches the counter. She slides the HP LaserJet 4050 across the scanner, and it beeps, and the clerk rings her up for twenty-two dollars and twenty-five cents plus tax, and she signs her name on the electronic pad.</p>
    
    <p>The receipt prints instantly—irony noted—and she carries the printer to her car in the rain, thirty-seven pounds of maybe, thirty-seven pounds of what if, thirty-seven pounds of continuing to participate in the fiction that solutions exist.</p>
    
    <p>She drives home through empty streets, the printer's box sliding slightly in the backseat every time she turns a corner. At home, she leaves it in the car. She goes inside, where the broken printer still sits on the kitchen table, and she makes coffee even though it's almost four AM, and she sits in her kitchen and listens to the rain.</p>
    
    <p>The insurance forms are still there, still needing to be printed, still due Friday. The new printer is still in the car, still in its box, still costing twenty-two dollars and twenty-five cents that she may or may not have been able to afford.</p>
    
    <p>Nothing has changed. Everything is exactly the same, except now she owns two printers, one dead and one untested, and it's raining, and she's drinking coffee at four in the morning, and Friday is still coming whether she's ready or not.</p>
    
    <div class="break">⟡</div>
    
    <p>By five AM, the coffee is gone and the rain has stopped, and she's still sitting at the kitchen table. The broken printer's display still shows 79.00FE Fatal Error. The insurance forms still need printing. The new printer still sits in her car, and she still hasn't decided whether to bring it inside.</p>
    
    <p>Her sister will call again later. The insurance deadline will still be Friday. The basement will still smell like mildew, and the house will still feel too big for one person, and Tuesday mornings will still arrive with their archaeology of small failures.</p>
    
    <p>But she bought the printer. That's something. Not a solution, not a breakthrough, not a moment of clarity that changes everything. Just a transaction completed at three-thirty-seven AM in the fluorescent buzz of continuing to try, even when trying feels like standing still.</p>
    
    <p>She finishes her coffee and goes to bed, leaving both printers where they are: one on the table, one in the car, both waiting for decisions she's not ready to make. She sleeps for two hours and wakes up to gray morning light and the sound of her alarm, and nothing has resolved itself while she slept.</p>
    
    <p>Nothing ever does.</p>
