  "description": "A harmonic piece where all 8 terrarium creatures become voices in a chorus. Each creature's STATE.md is read and translated into frequency, harmony, and timbral qualities. From Flicker's electric 816Hz to Drift's deep archaeological 117Hz, all singing together in the first night of the terrarium ecosystem."
