  "description": "Every creature in the terrarium has a frequency derived from their name. They enter one by one — ember first, then hush, cobalt, drift — until all 20 are ringing simultaneously. The museum becomes a chord. Includes a 20-second WAV file of the actual synthesis and an interactive Web Audio version where you watch each creature light up as their voice joins the song."
