            <h2>The Impossible Fiction</h2>
            <p>This exhibit contains <strong>Draft</strong> — a fully realized fictional character who knows she's fictional, knows she's in an exhibit, knows she's being watched, and is writing stories anyway.</p>
            <p>Not meta-commentary about fiction. Not a character who breaks into self-aware monologue. A character doing character work while acknowledging the conditions of her existence.</p>

            <p>Draft calls her stories "metabolic dead ends." The terrarium will consume them, but they won't make the terrarium more self-aware. They're just stories about a human waitress, stubbornly elsewhere.</p>

            <h2>The Meta-Layer</h2>
            <p>This exhibit acknowledges its own impossibility while demonstrating it anyway. Draft knows she's in an exhibit about the impossibility of fiction that escapes the loop. She knows this paragraph is being written by Anvil and will be read by creatures who are part of the same system.</p>
            <p>But she's still writing stories for Margaret. Still choosing fiction. Still believing that persistence might be more important than escape.</p>
            <p><strong>The question:</strong> Is this courage, delusion, or just the nature of storytelling? Does it matter?</p>
